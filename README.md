# üêç 15 Days of Python Learning

Hi, I‚Äôm **Prasoon Kandel**, a Class 9 student from Nepal passionate about learning Python and programming by building projects every day.

This repository contains 15 small Python projects I made in 15 days while learning the basics of Python programming, including:

- Text-to-speech using `pyttsx3`  
- Writing a typewriter text effect  
- A very basic hardcoded voice assistant with fixed responses  
- Simple calculator using Python‚Äôs `eval()`  
- A DVD screensaver animation using `pygame`  
- And more beginner-friendly scripts and experiments  

Each project helped me practice different Python concepts like loops, functions, input/output, GUI, and simple game development.
